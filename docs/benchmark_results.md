# Results

## Tabular Datasets

Below we compare speeds and compressed sizes on 3 real-world datasets.
All these results are available in
[the results CSV](./benchmark_results/mbp_m3_max_rust1_82.csv).
More results are visible in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06112).
All benchmarks reported here and in the paper can be easily run via
[the CLI](../pco_cli/README.md#bench).

The 3 datasets we compare here are:

* [Devin Smith's air quality data download](https://deephaven.io/wp-content/devinrsmith-air-quality.20220714.zstd.parquet)
  (15MB)
* [NYC taxi data (2023-04 high volume for hire)](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) (469MB)
* Reddit r/place 2022 data
  * [upstream Reddit post and original data](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/txvk2d/rplace_datasets_april_fools_2022/)
  * [processed Parquet file download](https://pcodec-public.s3.amazonaws.com/reddit_2022_place_numerical.parquet)
    (1.3GB)

For these results, we used a single performance core of a Macbook Pro M3 Max.
Only numerical columns were used.
For Blosc, the SHUFFLE filter and the Zstd default of Zstd level 3 was used.
For Parquet, the Parquet default of Zstd level 1 was used.

Even at max compression levels, Zstd-based codecs don't perform much better.
E.g. on the Taxi dataset, Parquet+Zstd at the max Zstd level of 22 and Blosc+Zstd
at the max Blosc level of 9 get ratios of 5.32 and 2.85, respectively.
In contrast, Pco gets 6.89 at level 8 and 6.98 at level 12.

## FCBench

Our harmonic average compression ratio on FCBench is the highest we are aware of: **1.956** at default compression level.
Here are the results for individual datasets:

At max compression level, the overall harmonic average compression ratio rises to **1.972**.
Note that many datasets in FCBench are row-oriented, and we have applied Pco to them as such, which Pco is not at all designed to do.
Our results happen to still competitive, but make sure to use Pco in a column-oriented fashion in the real world.
